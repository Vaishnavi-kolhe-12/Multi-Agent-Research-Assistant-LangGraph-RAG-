[...] Signs of this are already here: solar has been the largest source of new electricity for the last three years, and new drivers of demand such as EVs, heat pumps and data centres are contributing 0.7% to annual demand growth, more than twice as much as they did five years ago. [...] Despite geopolitical and economic headwinds, the renewables industry delivered an additional 858 TWh of generation to the system last year—more than the combined annual electricity consumption of the UK and France. Clean power now makes up over 40% of global power generation, proving that the momentum is unstoppable.
